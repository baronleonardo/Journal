a note taking application that is heavily inspired by OneNote.

## Setting up development environment
This project is based on the wonderful Qt framework.

If you're on Windows download and install it here: https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/
If you're on Linux use your package manager.
### Ubuntu
`sudo apt install sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools`
### Fedora
`sudo dnf install qt5-qt*`
### Arch
I don't know! If you have arch send a pull request to let the world know what commands to do!

I use qtcreator to develop and I recommend using it. The project uses qmake, so import the project to qtcreator and it should be fine as long as you have a recent version of qt.
